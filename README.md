## Description
Repository for [MTA](https://www.mta.ac.il/en/Pages/default.aspx) final Msc. project: Distributed RNTN.  
The purpose of this project is to implement the Recurssive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN) for sentiment analysis as described in the [paper](http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf) by R. Socher in a distributed manner using Apache Spark.   
We are following the [Downpour](http://research.google.com/archive/large_deep_networks_nips2012.html) paradigm described by Jeffrey Dean from google and implemented by Dirk Neumann's [DeepDist](http://deepdist.com/) project.  
  
Please bare in mind: This is a work in progress! This is, by no means, a download-and-run project.
